<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* yarn
  ```sh
  npm install --global yarn
  ```

### How to run cypress tests

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ModusCreateOrg/qa-coe-experiments
   ```
3. Install NPM packages under `cypress-studio` folder
   ```sh
   cd cypress-studio
   yarn
   ```
4. You can run cypress tests in two ways:

<!-- DOCKER SECTION -->
## How to run tests with docker 

### Prerequisites
Install the latest Docker engine on the local machine following instructions <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">here.</a>

### How to run cypress tests on the local machine
For executing tests without need to install cypress or nodejs on local machine run following in `cypress-studio` folder:
```sh
docker run -it -v $PWD:/e2e -w /e2e cypress/included:8.5.0
```

### Build docker image with tests
Run following in `cypress-studio`folder:
```sh
docker build -t modus/cypress-studio:latest .
```

Run tests locally:
```sh
docker run -it modus/cypress-studio:latest
```

### Push image in a docker repository

To push the image in a private repo, we have to retag the image to point on the target docker repository. Otherwise, the default is Dockerhub.

```sh
docker tag modus/cypress-studio:latest  path-to-private-repo.com/repo/cypress-studio:latest
```
Where `path-to-private-repo.com/repo/cypress-studio:latest`is provate target docker repository.

Credentials for the target docker repository are needed for the push.

Push image with:
```sh
docker push path-to-private-repo.com/repo/cypress-studio:latest
```

## Deploy on Kubernetes
### Prerequisites
Docker image is built and pushed in the target repository. Install `kubectl` tool and configure access to Kubernetes cluster.
Installation instructions are <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">here.</a><br>
Alternatively, run on a local machine mini cube - follow instructions <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/">here.</a>

### Kubernetes YAML example

Save following YAML as `modus-test-job.yaml`
```YAML
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: modus-cypress-test-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: modus-cypress-test-job
        image: path-to-private-repo.com/repo/cypress-studio:latest 
```

Deploy job on kubernetes:
```sh
kubectl apply -f modus-test-job.yaml
```

Find exact name of the jobs pod with:
```sh 
kubectl get pods
```

Using `kubectl logs modus-cypress-test-job-XXX` get logs/results where `modus-cypress-test-job-XXX`is the name of the job.
On development/testing, cluster logs could be redirected to the central logging system, and results could be visible there.
